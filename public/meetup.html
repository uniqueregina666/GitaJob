        <h2>Learn to Talk About Yourself (& to Others)</h2>

<h4>Learn to Talk About Yourself</h4>
<ul>
<li>To prepare for talking to recruiters/hiring managers, practice talking about the specific projects you’ve worked on. In particular, if your bootcamp had you work in groups for your final project, prepare to discuss your individual contribution and not just what the entire team worked on:</li>
  <ul>
    <li>What did you make? What does it do? What impact has it made? What was the hardest part? What could you have done better?</li>
    <li>Why did you make it? Was it for a hackathon, a school project, an open source contribution, or something else?</li>
    <li>With which technologies did you make this? Did you use a specific API? What parts of it did you work on?</li>
  </ul>
</ul>

<h4>Learn to Talk To Others</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Here are some tips for getting the most out of social interactions at events:</li>
  <ul>
    <li>Introduce yourself to someone who looks like they are alone. Tell them your name, and get their name. Now you have a buddy to navigate the event with.</li>
    <li>Make small talk about tech. You’re both there because you’re technologists. A common interest already!</li>
    <li>Exchange contact information before leaving the event so that you can follow up with them later. Today’s event buddy could be tomorrow’s referrer or hiring manager!</li>
    <li>If you don’t want to directly ask someone you just met for a job (awkward!), instead ask for advice/expertise a way that will indicate 1) that you’re on the hunt, and 2) that you’re passionate about programming/the tech world. Some example convo starters:</li>
    <ul>
      <li>“How did you get your first programming job?”</li>
      <li>“I’m finally out of school and on the job hunt - I finally have some free time and would love to learn a new language/start a new project. What new framework do you think I should try to pick up? Any cool open source projects you’ve heard of?”</li>
    </ul>
  </ul>
</ul>
