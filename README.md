        Description
		*gitaJob* “gitaJob” is a full stack web site that will be
	using Materialize on the Front End. We will also be incorporating
	a new node npm (TBD) as our new technology. We will be creating
	our own database . gitaJob is an all in one go to web site for
	employers and future employees in the Tech industry. Job seekers
	can take a quiz to see what type of job is well suited for them.
	They can also look up jobs or read articles on how to get a job/
	prepare for the workforce. Employers can post jobs and receive
	matches of users who took the survey, based upon the job they are
	posting for.
    

		*gitaJob* application is meant to simulate a simple
	Job app. The application is implemented using a
	[Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) and
	[MySQL.js](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mysql) and
           [Express](https://expressjs.com/) server on the backend and HTML
	with CSS on the front end.


##         Demo
## 
		*gitaJob* is deployed to Heroku. Please check it out
	[Demo]('').

##         Installation
## 
		To install the application follow the instructions below:

		git clone '' cd
	'' install

##         Running Locally
## 
		To run the application locally and access it in your browser,
	first set the `PORT` environment variable to the value of your
	choice. An example is shown below.

			export PORT=''

		After the `PORT` environment variable has been set, run the
	Node.js application with the command below.

			node server.js

		The application will now be running locally on `PORT`, in
	this case that is port 5000. You can then access it locally from
	your browser at the URL `localhost:PORT`, in this case
	`localhost:''.





#     node-js-getting-started
# 
	A barebones Node.js app using [Express 4](http://expressjs.com/).

	This application supports the [Getting Started with Node on
Heroku](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/getting-started-with-
nodejs) article - check it out.

##     Running Locally
## 
	Make sure you have [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/) and the [Heroku
CLI](https://cli.heroku.com/) installed.

	```sh $ git clone
git@github.com:heroku/node-js-getting-started.git # or clone your own
fork $ cd node-js-getting-started $ npm install $ npm start ```

	Your app should now be running on
[localhost:''](http://localhost:''/).

##     Deploying to Heroku
