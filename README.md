<h1>Description</h1>
		
“gitaJob” is a full stack web site that will be
using Materialize on the Frontend.We will be creating
our own database . gitaJob is an all in one go to web site for
employers and future employees in the Tech industry. Job seekers
can take a quiz to see what type of job is well suited for them.
They can also look up jobs or read articles on how to get a job/
prepare for the workforce. Employers can post jobs and receive
matches of users who took the survey, based upon the job they are
posting for.
    
The application is implemented using a
[node](https://nodejs.org/en/),
[mysql2](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mysql2),
[body-parse](https://www.npmjs.com/package/body-parser), and
[express](https://expressjs.com/) server on the backend and HTML
with CSS on the front end.


##         Demo
## 
		*gitaJob* is deployed to Heroku. Please check it out
	[Demo]('').

##         Installation
## 
		To install the application follow the instructions below:

		git clone '' cd
	'' install

##         Running Locally
## 
		To run the application locally and access it in your browser,
	first set the `PORT` environment variable to the value of your
	choice. An example is shown below.

			export PORT=''

		After the `PORT` environment variable has been set, run the
	Node.js application with the command below.

			node server.js

		The application will now be running locally on `PORT`, in
	this case that is port 5000. You can then access it locally from
	your browser at the URL `localhost:PORT`, in this case
	`localhost:''.





#     node-js-getting-started

CLI](https://cli.heroku.com/) installed.

	```sh $ git clone
git@github.com:heroku/node-js-getting-started.git # or clone your own
fork $ cd node-js-getting-started $ npm install $ npm start ```

	Your app should now be running on
[localhost:''](http://localhost:''/).
